The field can be useful during DRAM initialization, when training or calibration sequences are performed, and scheduler arbitration is not needed. When the field is set to 0, scheduler arbitration is fully functional, this is the functional usage mode. NOTE: When the field is set to 1, the final arbitration level continues to elect transactions among those presented to the arbiter. Set field ForceOrder to ensure that transactions are executed in order, for instance during DRAM initialization.
