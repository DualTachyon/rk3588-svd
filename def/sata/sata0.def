P0CMD = 0x0118 ; Port Command Register. This register contains bits controlling various Port functions.
> 28, 4, ICC ; This field is used to control power management states of the interface. When the Link layer is currently in the L_IDLE state or L_NoCommPower state, writes to this field cause the Port to initiate a transition to the interface power management state requested. When the Link layer is not currently in the L_IDLE state or L_NoCommPower, writes to this field have no effect. 4'h1: Active. This causes the Port to request a transition of the interface into the active state; 4'h2: Partial. This causes the Port to request a transition of the interface to the Partial state. The SATA device can reject the request and the interface remains in its current state; 4'h6: Slumber. This causes the Port to request a transition of the interface to the Slumber state. The SATA device can reject the request and the interface remains in its current state; Else: Reserved.
> 27, 1, ASP ; The options for this field are: When set to 1, and P0CMD.ALPE=1, the Port aggressively enters the SLUMBER state when one of the following conditions is true: The Port clears the P0CI and the P0SACT register is cleared. The Port clears the P0SACT register and P0CI is cleared. When cleared to 0, and P0CMD.ALPE=1, the Port aggressively enters the PARTIAL state when one of the following conditions is true: The Port clears the P0CI register and the P0SACT register is cleared. The Port clears the P0SACT register and P0CI is cleared.
> 26, 1, ALPE ; When set to 1, the Port aggressively enters a lower link power state (PARTIAL or SLUMBER) based on the setting of the P0CMD.ASP bit. When cleared to 0, aggressive power management state transition is disabled.
> 25, 1, DLAE ; When set to 1, P0CMD.ATAPI=1, and commands are active, the Port asserts P0_act_led output.

> 23, 1, APSTE ; When this bit is set and the SATA Host Link layer negotiates Partial power management state with the device, it transitions into the Slumber state directly, regardless whether it was host software-, Port (aggressive)-, or device-initiated.
> 22, 1, FBSCP ; When set to 1, indicates that this Port supports Port Multiplier FIS-based switching. When cleared to 0, indicates that this Port does not support FIS-based switching.
> 21, 1, ESP ; When set to 1, indicates that this Port's signal only connector is externally accessible. When set to 1, CAP.SXS is also set to 1. When cleared to 0, indicates that this Port's signal only connector is not externally accessible.

> 20, 1, CPD ;

> 18, 1, HPCP ;

> 8, 5, CCS ; This field is set to the command slot value of the command that is currently being issued by the Port. When P0CMD.ST transitions from 1 to 0, this field is cleared again to 5'h0. After P0CMD.ST transitions from 0 to 1, the highest priority slot to issue from next is command slot 0. After the first command has been issued, the highest priority slot to issue from next is P0CMD.CCS+1. 7:5 RO 0x0 reserved

> 4, 1, FRE ; When set to 1, the Port may post received FISes into the FIS receive area pointed to by P0FB. When cleared, received FISes are not accepted by the Port, except for the first D2H register FIS after the initialization sequence, and no FISes are posted to the FIS receive area. The software must not set this bit until P0FB has been programmed with a valid pointer to the FIS receive area. When the software wishes to move the base, this bit must first be cleared, and the software must wait for the P0CMD.FR bit to be cleared.

> 3, 1, CLO ; Setting this bit to 1 cause P0TFD.STS.BSY and P0TFD.STS.DRQ to be cleared to 0. This allows a software reset to be transmitted to the device regardless of whether the BSY and DRQ bits are still set in the P0TFD.STS register. This bit is cleared to 0 when P0TFD.STS.BSY and P0TFD.STS.DRQ have been cleared to 0. A write to this register with a value of '0' has no effect. This bit should only be set to 1 immediately prior to setting P0CMD.ST bit to 1 from a previous value of 0. Setting this bit to 1 at any other time is not supported and results in indeterminate behaviors.

> 2, 1, POD ; This bit is read/write when cold presence detection is supported on this Port as indicated by P0CMD.CPD=1. This bit is read-only 1 when cold presence detection is not supported and P0CMD.CPD=0.

> 1, 1, SUD ; This bit is read/write when staggered spin-up is supported as indicated by the CAP.SSS=1. This bit is read-only 1 when staggered spin-up is not supported and CAP.SSS=0. On an edge detect from 0 to 1, the Port starts a COMRESET initialization sequence to the device. Clearing this bit causes no action on the interface.

> 0, 1, ST ; When set to 1, the Port processes the command list. When cleared, the Port does not process the command list. Whenever this bit is changed from a 0 to a 1, the Port starts processing the command list at entry 0. Whenever this bit is changed from a 1 to a 0, the P0CI register is cleared by the Port upon transition into an idle state.
